Skeleton for the game.

To get up and running:

1. "npm install"
2. to launch server: from root directory "node index.js"

All css and js files are in the public directory along with assets.

If you use any packages please add them to the package.json by doing "npm install [package name] --save".

For easy updating "npm install -g nodemon" then "nodemon index.js". Refreshes server when you change it, so you dont have to!

Let's break shit.
